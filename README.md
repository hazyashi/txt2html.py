# txt2html.py
<h1>the name is self explanatory</h1>

I made this cause I wanted an easy way for me to make html web pages for a blog on my website without needing to add all my css and nav bar and formatting each time. As such the file here is one that is formatted specifically for my site. I can just write a text file and run this upload it to my site.
it will timestamp every file made by the hour.
